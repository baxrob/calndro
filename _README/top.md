This is a WIP POC. 
It's in an interim state with some cruft.
Briefly, its 
intent is similar to the core function of Calendly, or [cal.com](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com).

In summary:
> Invite registered or unregistered parties, narrow to agreement on a scheduled time span, send notification of updates, with <!--all--> actions logged

```
propose -> narrow -> agree : audit
```

There's no graphical interface, but a [tui](#tui) [or cli?]. 
The
[api](#interface)
is
small, with [somewhat and in the direction of] minimal corners.
[Install](#install) with venv/pip or docker.
[Tests](#tests)
may
give a 
simplest 
overview.
Below, 
you
can/may/will
find
some elaboration on
[design](#architecture-design-process)
process,
including some [stats](#stats)
and [workflow](#process) notes,
possible [future](#next-possibly)
expansion/s
and some
[background/contributing] /
[referential](#ref)
material.

First a scenario
